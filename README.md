This is a personal project to help integrate several web-based system managements into a single application, 
thus interfacing with several web systems simulatenously that all require the same information. 

Entirely on my own time, just meant to make a tedious process quicker and easier.

Planning to use the Splinter API, an extension of selenium, to emulate a web-browser interaction in order to 
fill forms and call javascript functions.
