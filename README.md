This is a personal project to help integrate several web-based system managements into a single application, 
thus interfacing with several web systems simulatenously that all require the same information. 

Entirely on my own time, just meant to make a tedious process quicker and easier.

<s>Planning to use the Splinter API, an extension of selenium, to emulate a web-browser interaction in order to 
fill forms and call javascript functions. </s>
Using the selenium API along with Firefox to drive the web-browser interaction and fill forms and call functions. 

Update 04/22/15: Issues utilizing a Firefox profile loading the Browser with the splinter API. 
Likely an issue with the development environment being restricted in the workgroup.
Switching to the Selenium WebDriver to load Firefox and configuration
